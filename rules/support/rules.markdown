# Minecraft Support

* __Topics can be "Bumped" every 12 hours if no one responds__

    This is allowed in this section because users actually need a response in this section.

* __Do not request support for cracked servers and/or cracked clients__

    We do not support the use of cracked clients or cracked servers, and therefore will not allow 
    people to request technical support for a cracked client/server. Support will also not be 
    provided for offline servers.

* __Do not participate in OS/Platform/Browser wars__

    No one operating system, platform, or browser was meant to run minecraft, and making topics or
    posts supporting a single OS/platform/browser will just degrade into flaming and trolling.
    
* __Do not redistribute property of Mojang__

    Do not distribute any property of Mojang to other members on the forum. This includes: the 
    Minecraft launcher, the Minecraft jar, and the Minecraft server client.

* __Do not give out or request personal information__

    Personal information includes: Your location, your birthday, your transaction id, and credit 
    card details. This information can be used to steal your Minecraft/Mojang account, and should 
    not be given out under any circumstances.

* __Do not request help on topics that do not relate to your issue__

    If you cannot find a topic that relates to your issue, then make a new topic about your issue. 
    Posting on random support threads will just make it harder for other people to get support.
    
* __Do not post forum support questions in this section__

    Forum support questions belong in the [Forum Discussion & Information section](www.minecraftforum.net/forum/4-forum-discussion-info/).
    
* __Do not thread jack__

    Thread jacking is not allowed. Thread jacking is posting on a topic in an attempt to divert 
    the topic to another user or direction. As errors may appear similar, they are usually caused 
    by multiple issues.
